## What is it?

This is a simple application which allows the user to create workout countdown timers. The application can also allow the user to time themselves using a stopwatch and then save the recorded time. This data can then be displayed in a graph.

## What platform is it for?

The application will only be developed for Android version 5.1 Lollipop (API level 22). Newer versions of Android may also be able to run this - however, it will not be officially supported.
